<p><b>Loading a Database</b></p>
<p>The first step is loading a database: a set of classified instances stored 
  on a file:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click <b>File &gt; Open</b> <img src="open.gif" width="16" height="16"></li>
  <li>Choose a file. Two formats are supported: arff and txt</li>
  <li>Click <b>Open</b></li>
  <li>The system asks if the file is compacted. On another words, if there is 
    an attribute defining each instance's weight. In afirmative case, click <b>Yes</b>, 
    and then choose the weight attribute. Otherwise, click <b>No</b>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The file loaded has to be on the form imposed by its format. Otherwise, the 
  loading will cause an error. To know how are these forms, see on <b>examples</b> 
  folder, there are many example files on both formats.</p>
<p>The arff format determines which attributes are numeric or nominal, the txt 
  format doesn't. If an attribute on a txt file has only numeric values and the 
  number of values exceeds the number of states allowed defined on the global 
  options (on main window: <b>Global Options &gt; Preferences</b>...), the attribute 
  is considered numeric, otherwise, nominal.</p>
<p>In case of a sucessfull loading, the <b>Attributes</b> tab is enabled (see 
  below). The class attribute is presented on the left, while the others are on 
  the right. Each attribute is represented as a folder containing its possible 
  values. By default, the class attribute is the last one on the loaded file. 
  The user can change the class attribute through the combo box located on this 
  same screen. The option of learning is enabled too. </p>
