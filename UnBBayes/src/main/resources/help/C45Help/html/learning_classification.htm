<p><b> Decision Tree Learning and Instances Classification</b></p>
<p>After loading a data file, the next step is to apply the decision tree learning:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Set preferences about prunning, gain ratio and verbosity at <b>Learning 
    &gt; Preferences</b> (optional) <img src="global-options.gif" width="16" height="16"></li>
  <li>Click <b>Learning &gt; Learn Decision Tree </b> <img src="learn.gif" width="16" height="16"></li>
</ol>
<p>After the successfull learning, two tabs are enabled (if they weren't): <b>Inference 
  </b>and <b>Verbosity.</b> The first represents the created tree, while the second 
  presents data about calculated gains and intermediate instance sets.</p>
<p>The tree represented on <b>Inference</b> tab can be used to classify new instances. 
  The nodes that aren't above leaves represents a point of decision. When the 
  user clicks on one of these nodes, the decisions possible from this point (the 
  values of an attribute) are shown on the right. When one of these decisions 
  are taken, the node relative to the decision is selected. If this node isn't 
  above a leaf, the relative decisions are shown on the right. Else, the leaf 
  classification is shown. So, the user can click on a tree node (the root is 
  a good choice) and asks the questions on the right, what represents the attributes 
  values of the new instance, until the classification appears in red. The images 
  above presents the two nodes situations. </p>
