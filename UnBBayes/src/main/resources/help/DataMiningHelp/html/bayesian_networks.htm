<h1><font size="6">Bayesian Networks</font></h1>
<hr>
<p>Bayesian networks are a knowledge representation formalism. They were
originally developed to capture and use the domain knowledge of some human
expert in order to develop automated reasoning systems.</p>
<p>A Bayesian network is a graph where nodes represent stochastic variables and
(arrowhead) arcs represent dependencies among these variables. A variable can
take a finite set of values. For instance, suppose that you want to represent
the variable <font color="#00659c">Gender</font>. The variable <font color="#00659c">Gender</font>
may take two possible values: <font color="#00659c">Male</font> and <font color="#00659c">Female</font>.
The assignment of a value to a variable is called the state of the variable. So,
the variable Gender has two states: <font color="#00659c">Gender = Male</font>
and <font color="#00659c">Gender = Female</font>. The graphical structure of a
Bayesian network looks like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../icones/basic_bbn_net.gif" width="389" height="205"></p>
<p>The network represent notion that Obesity and Gender affects the <font color="#006699">Heart_Condition</font>
of a patient. The variable <font color="#00659c">Obese</font> can take three
values: <font color="#00659c">Yes</font>, <font color="#00659c">Borderline</font>
and <font color="#00659c">No</font>. The variable <font color="#006699">Heart_Condition</font>
has two states: <font color="#00659c">True</font> and <font color="#00659c">False</font>.</p>
<p>We said that the variables used in a Bayesian networks are stochastic. This
mean that the assignment of a value to a variable is represented by a
probability distribution. For instance, if we do not know for sure what is the
gender of a patient, we may want to encode the information that we have better
chances of having a female patient rather than a male one. This guess could be
based, for instance, on statistical considerations, but this may not be our
unique source of information. So, for the sake of this example, let's say that
there are 80% chances of being <font color="#00659c">Female</font> and 20% of
being <font color="#00659c">Male</font>.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../icones/basic_bbn_gender.gif" width="148" height="69"></p>
<p>Similarly, we can encode that the incidence of obesity is 10% and there is a
20% of borderline cases.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../icones/basic_bbn_obesity.gif" width="224" height="69"></p>
<p>The following set of distributions tries to encode the fact that obesity
increases the cardiac risk of a patient, but this effect is more significant in
men than women.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../icones/basic_bbn_heart.gif" width="296" height="139"></p>
<p>The dependency is modeled by a set of probability distributions, one for each
combination of states of the variables <font color="#00659c">Gender</font> and <font color="#00659c">Obesity</font>,
called the parent variables of <font color="#00659c">Heart_Condition</font>.</p>
<p>Once the network has been defined, it can be used to solve problems, make
predictions, and find explanations. In a word, they can be used for reasoning
about real or hypothetical cases.</p>
<p>When compared with traditional production rule-based systems, systems
developed using Bayesian networks do not encode heuristic rules but explicit
representation of dependencies dictated by the domain knowledge. This feature
makes easier the acquisition and maintenance of the knowledge base.</p>
