<p>Now, the awaited list:</p>
<ul><li><i>Although the above approaches are promising where applicable, a workable solution for the Semantic Web requires a general-purpose formalism that gives ontology designers a range of options to balance tractability against expressiveness. Current research on SW formalisms using first-order probabilistic logics is still in its infancy, and generally lack a complete set of publicly available tools. Examples include PR-OWL (Costa, 2005), which is an upper ontology for building probabilistic ontologies based on MEBN logic, and KEEPER (Pool and Aiken, 2004), an OWL-based interface for the relational probabilistic toolset Quiddity*Suite, developed by IET, Inc. Their constructs are similar in spirit and provide an expressive method for representing uncertainty in OWL ontologies. Costa (2005) gives a definition for Probabilistic Ontologies, develops rules for constructing PR-OWL ontologies in a manner that can be translated into Quiddity*Suite, and describes how to perform the translation. Carvalho et al. (2007) and Costa et. al. (2008) present an open source, Java-based, PR-OWL/MEBN GUI and reasoner package, UnBBayes-MEBN, that greatly facilitates the process of building probabilistic ontologies and reasoning with them.</i><p><a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/urw3/XGR-urw3-20080331/" class="externalLink"> Uncertainty Reasoning for the World Wide Web - W3C Incubator Group Report</a></p>
</li>
<li><i>UnBBayes allows a more adequate and better visualization of the MTheory and MFrags being created, as well as their nodes. In short, it is not difficult to perceive the advantages of building POs with the GUI implemented in UnBBayes.</i><p><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5-ZLTy1gby4C&amp;pg=PA97&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;dq=unbbayes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a0Su-2GG8V&amp;sig=Hm88qPlJhq7X_ncmZICr5A1pH9o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5g8TSru-MKCm8QTi1dmKBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#PPA97,M1" class="externalLink"> Uncertainty Reasoning for the Semantic Web I</a></p>
</li>
<li><i>However, building MFrags in a probabilistic ontology is a manual, error prone, and tedious process. Avoiding errors or inconsistencies requires deep knowledge of the logic and of the data structures of PR-OWL, since the user would have to know all technical terms such as hasPossibleValues, is-NodeFrom, isResidentNodeIn, etc. In an ideal scenario, many of these terms could be omitted and filled automatic by a software application projected to enforce the consistency of a MEBN model.</i><p><i>The development of UnBBayes-MEBN [12, 13], an open source, Java-based application that is currently in alpha phase (public release March 08), is an important step towards this objective, as it provides both a GUI for building probabilistic ontologies and a reasoner based on the PR-OWL/MEBN framework.</i></p>

<li><i>The probabilistic network for the speed decision is generated from the existing data. So instead of building up the network and defining the probability function later on, the data is given and the UnBBayes learning tool [1] generates the nodes and afterward gives the definition of the relations between the nodes, thus the probability functions are calculated.</i><p><a href="http://www.iasi.cnr.it/ewgt/16conference/ID88.pdf" class="externalLink"> A Self-Learning Driving Behavior Model for Microscopic Online Simulation based on Remote Sensing and Equipped Vehicle Data</a></p>

<li><i>This article describes cooperation with the Brazilian Federal Police (DPF/INI) and the academia to use data mining techniques to make faster the criminal identification based on the matching of deca-dactylograms. The DPF/INI fingerprint files use the Vucetichs system that codes all the ten fingers of a person with a unique dactyloscopic formula. Many times, only fragments of fingerprints are found in the scene of the crime. Our goal is to study how to deal with this missing of information to reduce the search space into the fingerprints identification processes. To infer missing codes, we had tested classifier based on naïve Bayes, Bayesian network, decision tree, neural network, and CNM. As a result, Lupa Digital was developed in Java (&lt;&lt;using UnBBayes</i>&gt;).&gt;<p><a href="https://www.sbc.org.br/bibliotecadigital/?module=Public&amp;action=PublicationObject&amp;subject=0&amp;publicationobjectid=23" class="externalLink"> (Lupa Digital: Agilizacao da Busca Decadactilar na Identificacao Criminal Atraves de Mineracao de Dados)</a></p>

<li><i>According to Marcelo Ladeira, UnBBayes works as the problem solver from Microsoft Windows. There, the user answers a series of objective questions to find out the possible causes to the problem. The same thing happens in UnBBayes: the physician enters the symptoms and the computer answers with a diagnostic. The program also allows the physician to ask why and why not the computer got a certain conclusion.</i> (Free translation)<p><a href="http://www2.correioweb.com.br/cw/EDICAO_20020723/sup_etu_230702_14.htm" class="externalLink"> Article in a Brazilian Newspaper (E grave, computador?)</a></p>
